FlyingWhale Airline Data Analysis
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of flight data for FlyingWhale Airline. The focus of the analysis was on uncovering key insights into customer behavior and trends, with the goal of improving customer loyalty and retention strategies. Key areas of analysis included:

Monthly flight booking patterns
Customer demographics segmented by marital status
Points earned based on travel distance and redeemed with companions
Bookings categorized by loyalty card membership and gender
Median travel distance by loyalty card tier
Customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis by loyalty card
